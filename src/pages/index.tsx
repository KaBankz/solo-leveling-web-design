                Sung Jin-Woo (성진우)
                <br />
                is the protagonist of Solo Leveling. He was previously known as
                the World&apos;s Weakest Hunter and delved down the path of
                becoming the World&apos;s Strongest Hunter after he was
                Reawakened and became a Player
                <br />
                Jin-Woo was reawakened as a Player after surviving the Cartenon
                Temple and completing the secret quest &quot;Courage of the
                Weak&quot;. The mysterious System has allowed Jin-Woo to
                limitless level up and increases his strength, unlike all
                hunters, who are unable to increase their strength unless
                reawakened.
